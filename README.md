## Hey You, Glad You Found Me ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™m a software engineer with a Bachelorâ€™s in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a Masterâ€™s in Artificial Intelligence. My technical foundation is built on **C++** and **Python**, with theoretical expertise in **expert systems**, **constrained optimization**, and more. Iâ€™ve always been drawn to the elegance of algebra and statistics, and over time, Iâ€™ve developed a deep passion for **computer graphics**, **machine learning**, and **statistical learning theory**. Whatâ€™s better than finding creative ways to blend them all together?  

Here, youâ€™ll find a mix of personal projects and writings. Currently, Iâ€™m working on:  
- **Tetrahedron-Tetrahedron Intersection** and **Volume Computation using Neural Networks**.  
- An introductory series on **Statistical Learning Theory** for undergrads.  

Stay tuned! :D
