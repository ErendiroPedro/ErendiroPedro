> "I think the universe is pure geometry – a beautiful shape twisting around and dancing over space-time." — Antony Garrett Lisi

I’m drawn to patterns, and to the hidden complexity behind apparent simplicity.  
Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about **predicates**: what are they really, and where do they come from? I have a feeling there’s a bit of reality hidden in the answers to these questions.  

Anyway, If you want a Go match [find me on OGS](https://online-go.com/player/761486/).  

I’m an engineer and (pseudo) researcher, and my main interests lie in geometry, statistics, and machine learning, most projects here live somewhere in that intersection.
