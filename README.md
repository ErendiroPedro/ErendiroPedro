# Hey you! 👋
I guess we finally meet. I don't know what brought you here, but I hope cool shapes make you stay.

I'm an engineer and (pseudo)researcher who really likes geometry, statistics, and machine learning — so expect most projects here to live somewhere in this intersection.

Other than that, I'm also open to Go matches! → [Find me on OGS](https://online-go.com/player/761486/)

## What I'm interested in right now
* **Piano Mover's Problem** — there's something beautiful about finding paths through impossible spaces
* **Situational Awareness Foundational Models** — how do we teach machines to really understand what's happening around them?

I want to pack as much knowledge into my head as possible, and make learning my lifelong mission. If that resonates, you might enjoy poking around my projects.
